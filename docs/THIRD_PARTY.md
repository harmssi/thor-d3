# Third-party code in the Diablo III port

The tree in `dm/` is a fork of d2r-mobile (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 jhaizhou, kept in the root `LICENSE`; its Java package is
`com.xiaoboluo.d2r`), extended first for DOOM Mobile and then for DOOM Eternal, Xenoblade 2 and Diablo III; the third-party
code d2r-mobile brought is listed in [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) and its contributors in
[upstream/README-d2r-mobile.md](upstream/README-d2r-mobile.md). Code was also ported from other MIT-licensed projects.
Each ported file says so in a comment and keeps the original copyright line.

Diablo III code is behind `DM_GAME_D3`; the DOOM / DOOM Eternal / Xenoblade 2 code behind `DM_GAME_DOOM` / `DM_GAME_ETERNAL` /
`DM_GAME_XC2` (Diablo III builds `DM_GAME_DOOM` + `DM_GAME_D3`, see [d3/D3_GATES.md](d3/D3_GATES.md)).

## Ideas from BOTWRecompAndroid (MIT)

Studied on 28.10.2026 for DOOM Mobile. No files were copied; the ideas below were re-implemented in our code, which names
the source in a comment.

| Our code | Idea from | What |
|---|---|---|
| `dm/android/vk_driver.c`, `vk_tramp.S` / `vk_tramp_names.h` | BOTWRecompAndroid `runtime/nvn/vulkan/android_driver.c` (adrenotools + volk) | Vulkan driver chosen at run time (system driver or Turnip through libadrenotools, `DM_VK_DRIVER`); we use trampolines instead of volk |
| `gfx/nvn/hle_nvn.c` `nvnSyncWait` (`DM_NVN_SYNC_LAG=1`, off by default) | BOTWRecompAndroid 82b71e2 "sync lag" | Wait for the fence of frame N-1 instead of N |
| `gfx/nvn/nvn_obj.h` `FITS55` limits | BOTWRecompAndroid NVN object writes | Size limits of NVN 55 objects (DOOM Eternal) |

No code or idea from LASRecomp / LASRecompAndroid (Peiikai, mamcjr) is in this tree; they are credited in the DOOM Mobile
repository, where they apply.

## Not redistributed

- Khronos Vulkan validation layers (Apache-2.0): optional for debugging (`build.bat -Validation`), you download them yourself.
- Mesa Turnip: downloaded at build time (see above).
- The .NET SDK, Python and its packages (cryptography, zstandard, lz4, capstone, unicorn): installed by setup into
  `tools/.runtime` on the player's PC from their official sources.
