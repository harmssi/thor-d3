# What came over from the DOOM 2016 port (05.11.2026)

Device compatibility, diagnostics and generic fixes of DOOM Mobile (public repository `Desm0nt/doom-port`) ported to the
Diablo III host. Everything is built (normal APK minSdk 31, `-Android10` APK minSdk 29); on the phone only Adreno 750
can be checked, so everything non-Adreno is **built, not tested on hardware**. D3's tuned defaults are unchanged:
`DM_GFX_DEFER_EVENTS=2`, `DM_GFX_IDLE_RETIRE=2`, `DM_GFX_SUBMIT_CHUNK_US=0`, zero-copy on Adreno with the chunk retire,
`DM_DIRTY_UNPROT_KB=64` and the VMA watch, REPORT_INPASS / NAN_SAT / LAZY_CLEAR / LDC_CANON / F2I_NOTRUNC, the loading
screen stretch, widescreen, the D3 touch pad and the unified pause menu.

## Logs, breadcrumbs, crash reports

| DOOM | D3 | What |
|---|---|---|
| 7c0da0e, fc66617 | 0a395cc | `boot.log` per run (previous: `boot.prev.log`), cut back to its first 4 MB past `DM_LOG_MAX_MB` (32); header lines (`boot: log`, `boot: device`, `boot: gpu`); every `__android_log_print` of the library in the file (`-Wl,--wrap`); crash marker `files/dm-crash.txt` + fsync of the log from the signal handler; SIGABRT / SIGFPE reported too; fault-loop detector; `[life]`, `boot: Vulkan initialized in N ms` and other boot breadcrumbs; `[res] first open <archive>.cpk` |
| 7c0da0e, fc66617 | e5f64e0 | `CrashLog.java`: at the next start after a native crash, a Java exception, a start error or a death while playing (`dm-session.txt`, Android 11+ `ApplicationExitInfo`) → `Download/Diablo3Mobile/logs/crash.txt` (previous `crash.prev.txt`; fallback `Android/data/org.diablo3.port/files/logs/`), a toast; `boot.log` / `boot.prev.log` mirrored there on stop; `[java] …` breadcrumbs (driver decision, status, first frames, trim memory, nativeStart) |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | `DM_GFX_CRUMBS=1|2` (default 0): GPU progress markers; on a fatal or a GPU stall (`DM_GFX_CRUMBS_STALL_MS`, 2000) `NVN crumbs …` lines name the in-flight work |
| 3a0d4a7 | dab7fda | on-demand dump: create the file `dm/dump` in the runtime folder → the next 300-present check prints every guest thread's wait into boot.log |
| — (D3) | 0a395cc, 5b1ca71 | D3 breadcrumbs: `[d3ui] crumb t s: focus … | active …` (UI reader, `DM_D3_UI_CRUMBS`, default 1, ≤ 8 lines/s), `[wide] loading screen #n at t s` / `#n over`, `[vma] … at t s maps …`, `NVN idle retire: first submission retired …` and `… not signalled after N s` (once per submission) |

Check on the phone: `grep -E "boot: log|boot: device|boot: gpu|boot: cpu|\[vk\] driver choice|\[java\] driver|first frames|\[life\]|\[res\] first open|\[d3ui\] crumb|loading screen #" files/dm/boot.log`.
Forced crash: `kill -SEGV <pid>` while playing → next start: toast + `Download/Diablo3Mobile/logs/crash.txt` with `reason: native crash (signal=11 …)`.

## Vulkan driver choice

| DOOM | D3 | What |
|---|---|---|
| 60ec064, d002c02, 3865197, 7c0da0e, fc66617 | bd1ec6b (native), e5f64e0 (app) | default driver by GPU (Adreno 6xx/7xx bundled Turnip; 710/720/722 and 8xx their downloaded Turnip package; non-Adreno system), packages downloaded when online from DOOM's public `drivers/manifest.json` (SHA-256 checked; the same manifest is copied into this repository as `drivers/manifest.json`), packages for another GPU family / glibc builds / missing libraries hidden and never loaded (`DM_VK_DRIVER_FORCE=1` tries anyway), the take-over verified (`verified=1`), fallback message with the reason. D3's crash guard (two launches dying before the first frame → system driver) kept and merged |

## Non-Adreno GPUs (Mali, PowerVR, Xclipse)

| DOOM | D3 | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8ca23ae | d0b0384 | no `geometryShader` / formatless storage without `format_feature_flags2`: module unusable, draws / dispatches skipped (was fatal) | ported |
| 8ca23ae | d0b0384 | no `shaderImageGatherExtended`: capability removed, non-constant offsets dropped | ported |
| 8ca23ae | d0b0384 | no D24 (Xclipse): D32 stand-ins with unorm ↔ float on uploads / readbacks | ported |
| 8ca23ae | d0b0384 | queue without timestamps: CPU clock for game timestamp reports (was fatal); timestamp mask with 0 valid bits | ported |
| 8ca23ae | d0b0384 | storage texture whose format has no STORAGE_IMAGE: logged | ported |
| 8ca23ae | (already in D3) | lone-lane rewrite when the subgroup is not 32 wide (`DM_GFX_WARP_MODE`) | present |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | `xbg_vendor_policy.h`: family by vendorID / name, `DM_GFX_SIM_GPU` simulation, per-family defaults (Adreno = old behaviour, host test passes) | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | sampler on a non-filterable format → NEAREST, anisotropy off (`DM_GFX_SAMPLER_STRICT=1` = fatal) | ported (replaces D3's narrower XC2 fallback) |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | depthBounds / fillModeNonSolid / depthBiasClamp missing → dropped (were fatal) | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | graphics pipeline build failure not fatal, `VK_INCOMPLETE` with a handle = built, compute likewise | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | PowerVR serial pipeline builds (`DM_GFX_PIPE_SERIAL`), `DM_GFX_PIPE_CACHE_LOAD=0` | ported |
| 7c0da0e | — | DOOM's graphics pipeline in-flight markers (`DM_GFX_PIPE_GUARD`) | not used: D3 keeps its Eternal graphics pipeguard for that |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | `vkWaitForFences` → `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` retried (engine and presenter) | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | null storage image / texel buffer without `nullDescriptor`: writable dummy (was fatal) | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | image usage refused as a whole → retry without STORAGE, then without attachment use | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | texel buffer views cut to `maxTexelBufferElements`; vertex formats without VERTEX_BUFFER widened | ported |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | zero-copy only on Adreno; PowerVR without dynamic UBOs; colour writes masked for draws without FS outputs on non-Adreno | ported (Adreno defaults unchanged) |
| 7c0da0e | 9fff6df | `NVN fallbacks on this device: …`, `NVN gpu family=… policy …` | ported |
| fc66617 | 3b976dd | chunked uploads (`DM_GFX_BC_BATCH_MB`, 32) for decoded BC and > 256 MB staging | ported |
| fc66617 | 3b976dd | GPU BC decode (`DM_GFX_BC_DECODE=gpu`, Granite BC6H/BC7), BC6H → E5B9G9R9 (`DM_GFX_BC6_E5`), decoded partial uploads (`DM_GFX_BC_PARTIAL`) | ported; host test passes |
| fc66617 | — | setup ASTC / ETC2 / EAC overlay | skipped: DOOM's tool rewrites id Tech BIM textures in `.resources`; D3's textures live in CPK archives with another format. The engine side came along and stays inert (`DM_GFX_ASTC_FORMATS` is never set) |
| fc66617 | bd1ec6b | custom driver really taken over (`verify_custom`), family / glibc / DT_NEEDED checks | ported |
| 26025a1 | — | presenter timestamp queries only with `timestampValidBits` | not needed: D3's presenter queries only with the `gfx-present-timing` marker (off) |

## Other

| DOOM | D3 | What |
|---|---|---|
| a251eb4 | af0f0c4 | ARMv8.0 CPUs: NVN thunks, `DM_NVN_PROF` entry and `DM_HLECOUNT` stubs choose LSE or v8.0 at boot (`DM_CPU_NOLSE=1` forces v8.0); `boot: cpu …` line. libdm.so audit: v8.1+ only in the LSE thunks / profiler entry and the NDK outline-atomics helpers; `patch_nso.py` and the `hle_d3.c` runtime patches emit v8.0 encodings only |
| b573fda | 126f44e, e5f64e0 | Android 10 build: `build_apk.ps1 -Android10` → `work/D3-port-debug-android10.apk` (native tree `work/build-android29`, minSdk 29), legacy storage permission, guarded Android 11+ calls |
| d89997e | fef8b01 | start screens name `Download/Diablo3Mobile` (13 languages) |
| a2e751e | e5f64e0 | the on-screen pad is not hidden by built-in pseudo gamepads (DOOM issue #5); the Grouped / Separate editor toggle is DoomPadView-only (skipped) |
| 8ca23ae | 3c0f516 | `DM_DIRTY_BLOCKS` (default 1): per-64-page summaries make texture dirty checks cheap, same answers |
| 8ca23ae | (already in D3) | NaN-safe saturate (`DM_GFX_NAN_SAT`), frame rate cap (`nvn_pace_cap_hz`) |
| 3a0d4a7 | (already in D3) | cube map array layout (×6 bug) |
